## Assignment
This homework is designed to provide experience working with semaphores. 
Included is a skeleton program that creates 10 PCBs and executes them in an 
infinite loop. Each process randomly calls wait or signal on a shared semaphore.
The goal of the HW is to correctly implement the wait and signal functions. 

If implemented correctly, there should come a point when all of the PCBs are 
blocked on the semaphore Q.
